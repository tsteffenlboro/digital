# Digital Engineering

This is a trial site for the module Digital Engineering. It uses JupyterLite on GitHub Pages to provide an interactive experience.

## Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

It does seem to work fine in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Brave, too. 

## Jupyter Notebook

All these notebooks can be opened in Jupyter Notebook locally. Anaconda is a convenient way to set this up. This does require the following additional packages (slideshow seems to need the conda-forge channel):

* ipywidgets
* ipycanvas
* jupyterlab-slideshow
* scipy
* symps

Additional packages may be useful, but should not be required.
